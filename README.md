# Nakul Mitra - Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio. Below you'll find a curated list of my personal and professional projects along with short descriptions and key technologies used.

## About Me

I'm a passionate Software Developer with over 4 years of experience in building robust backend systems using Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Redis. I specialize in designing scalable microservice architectures and have a keen interest in performance optimization and system design.

## Professional Projects

### 1. Prime Events (TCS - Internal Project)
- **Role:** Project Lead
- **Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, Redis, PostgreSQL, SlF4J, Maven, AOP, AngularJS, REST API
- **Note:** Internal project - not publicly accessible.
> Prime Events is a robust event management platform supporting diverse event types like meetings, workshops, and ideathons. Features include configurable questionnaires, participant submissions, jury evaluations, idea ranking, offline evaluations, and analytics exports. I led backend development and handled tech stack migration, system optimization, and feature enhancements.

## Personal Projects

### 1. URL Shortener
- **Tech Stack:** Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, PostgreSQL, Redis, Maven, AOP, Exception Handling, Logging (Logback), REST API
- 👉🏻 [View Project](https://github.com/nakulmitra/url-shortner)
> A scalable and performant backend system for shortening long URLs, retrieving original URLs, and tracking usage statistics. The application is optimized for high traffic and extendable for future architectural improvements.

> This application allows you to:
> 1. Enter a long/original URL and get a shortened version.
> 2. Provide a short URL and retrieve the original long URL.
> 3. Keep track of how many times each shortened URL is accessed.

**Features**
> 1. Short URL generation using random encoding.
> 2. Long URL retrieval via unique short keys.
> 3. Click tracking for each shortened URL.
> 4. Redis caching to offload read operations from PostgreSQL.
> 5. Structured audit and application logs saved in daily rotating files.
> 6. Redis-based rate limiting for public API protection.
> 7. Centralized global exception handling for all endpoints.

### 2. Vegetation Classification using Leaf Images
- **Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, CNN
- 👉🏻 [View Project](https://github.com/nakulmitra/Vegetation-Classification-based-on-Leaf-Pattern)
> Implemented an image classification model using CNN to categorize leaf images into 7 vegetation classes. Achieved 96.4% accuracy on the validation dataset using 350 training and 92 testing images.


### 3. COVID-19 Tracker
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Tkinter, REST APIs
- 👉🏻 [View Project](https://github.com/nakulmitra/Covid-19-Tracker)
> A Python-based application that fetches live COVID-19 statistics via APIs and presents real-time global and country-specific case data.


### 4. Scientific Calculator
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Tkinter
- 👉🏻 [View Project](https://github.com/nakulmitra/Scientific-Calculator)
> A GUI-based calculator application developed using Python that supports scientific computations and functions like trigonometry, logarithms, exponentiation, and more.


## Dev Portal (YouTube Projects)
